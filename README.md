## Jeff Roberts - About Me

# **Bio**
### Hello, my name is Jeff Roberts and I am a first year student in the Masters of Science in Business Analytics at the University of Iowa. My experience in the program has shown me that I truly enjoy working with data and tranlating it into a story. As you can see from my projects below, I enjoy observing big data sets and constructing key findings, visualizing the data for all to interpret.
